"""FlexAttention-style epilogue authoring: a plain Python function over the
accumulator, lowered onto the EpiOp machinery. The design in one page:

Layer map
---------
* quack.epi_ops       — EpiOps: per-tensor RESOURCE lifecycle (smem, TMA,
                        fragments, flushes: begin/begin_loop/end_loop/end),
                        host schema hooks (host_arg_key/host_fake_arg/
                        host_call_arg), and VALUE PORTS (below).
* quack.gemm_host     — generic host layer: one jit-cached compile fn (the
                        kernel CLASS is a key argument — classes pickle by
                        module+qualname, so disk keys are stable and async
                        workers import the right module by unpickling), plan
                        cache/build/run driven entirely by the op schema.
* this module         — the fn contract + kernel-class minting. A mod is ONE
                        Python function called per element at trace time; the
                        minted class is a standard ComposableEpiMixin subclass,
                        so hand-written mixins remain first-class and anything
                        the fn form can't express (e.g. symmetric's scheduler)
                        stays a mixin.
* quack.epilogues     — the library of ready mods and reusable ops.

The fn contract
---------------
``fn(acc, **operands) -> {"D": ..., <outputs/sinks>...}``, called once per
accumulator element (or pair). Values are Float32 scalars on pre-SM100 and
:class:`F2` packed pairs on SM100 (same scalar-or-f32x2 contract as
quack.activation, whose functions compose directly; F2 arithmetic lowers to
packed f32x2 intrinsics). ``"D"`` is optional — omit it to leave the raw
accumulator. Loop shapes mirror the hand-written mixins exactly; no tracer
guesses about vectorization.

* OPERANDS are the fn's parameter names after ``acc``. Kinds are inferred
  from tensor metadata at plan time: (l, n) row broadcast / (l, m) col
  broadcast ((total_m,) rank-1 under varlen) / (l, m, n) full-tile load /
  python scalar or 1-element tensor -> Scalar. ``c`` is reserved for the GEMM
  C operand. ``ops={name: EpiOp(...)}`` pins a name to an explicit op when
  inference is ambiguous (m == n) or the op is custom.
* PAIRING (gated / dgated) is also inferred — aux buffer at half GEMM-N pairs
  the accumulator over adjacent N columns; 16-bit C at twice GEMM-N packs C
  and D two lanes per f32 element — and expressed in the body via
  ``unpack``/``pack`` (see :class:`Pair`, whose arithmetic is lane-wise).
  ``paired=("acc",)`` declares pairing when tensors give no signal (RoPE:
  full-width D, no aux).
* SINKS: ``outputs=(names,)`` declares aux tile stores (each TileStore owns
  its own dtype/rounding, so multiple mixed-dtype outputs compose); ``reduces={name:
  ColVecReduce/RowVecReduce(name, combine="add"|"max")}`` declares reduce
  outputs (fn returns the per-element value; buffers are per-CTA-tile
  partials). A reduce of a PRODUCT should use ``scaled=True`` and return the
  two factors — ``{"sqsum": (x, x)}`` — so the fold is one fused
  ``fma(val, scale, acc)``: the product is never rounded on its own (bitwise
  parity with folding the product directly, one FFMA instead of FMUL+FADD).
  ``outs={name: sink_op}`` is the general form for any sink op
  (e.g. OnlineLSEReduce's coupled (max, sum) accumulator).
* PREPASS: ``prepass=fn2, prepass_outs=(names,)`` runs fn2 over the RAW
  accumulator before any store (driver flag epi_needs_acc_prepass; needs a
  re-readable accumulator — SM90 registers, SM100 tmem with no_release;
  pingpong is fine, its per-warpgroup epilogues are strictly exclusive so the
  stats smem is only temporally shared), feeding prepass sink ops; the same
  op then serves the main fn as a value operand carrying the finalized
  statistic (QK-norm: sq-sums -> dense rstd*w multiplier). Any transform the
  statistics must see is explicit duplicate math in fn2 — by design.
* VARLEN: pass ``cu_seqlens_m`` (and ``A_idx`` for gather); operands/outputs
  are (total_m, ...) shaped, colvecs rank-1. No prepass or TileLoad under
  varlen yet.

Value ports (how new ops join the fn dataflow)
----------------------------------------------
An EpiOp declares ``fn_port``:
* "value": the fn receives op.name as a value; ``fn_prepare`` turns the op's
  begin_loop state into a dense per-loop-index fragment.
* "apply": the fn receives a CALLABLE — ``y = rope(acc)`` — so the op's math
  slots into the fn dataflow at a user-chosen, review-visible point.
* "sink": the fn returns op.name; the frontend collects a dense fragment and
  hands it to ``fn_sink_flush`` once per subtile (fragment-level, so sinks own
  aliasing/coupled-accumulator numerics and per-subtile rescales).
One method makes a custom op compose with everything else here.

Speed-of-light rules (bugs otherwise; all were hit once)
--------------------------------------------------------
* Inside cutlass.range bodies, python-static branches must be
  ``const_expr(...)`` (dict comprehensions dodge the AST rewriting).
* vectorize=True demands plain loop-index addressing (no 2*i — use
  flat_divide pair views) and nonzero strides (densify broadcast fragments
  with an unrolled scalar copy first; see the _dense helpers).
* Sinks fold at fragment level: per-element accumulation into the zero-stride
  aliased accumulator slice double-counts on the SM100 packed path.
* Ragged last N-tile: OOB accumulator lanes are ZERO — the identity for add,
  not for max (reduce |x|-like quantities) and not for LSE (OnlineLSEReduce
  predicates OOB per element by default; check_oob=False compiles the
  predicate out and the host then requires divisible N).

Caching and identity
--------------------
An EpiMod's ``semantic_key`` deep-fingerprints the fn (source plus every
global/closure it references, recursively — factory patterns and helper
edits change it; formatting does not) together with the prepass fn, outputs,
mode, and each op's ``cache_key()`` (type + name + ``config_key()``). The
fingerprint is FAIL-CLOSED: primitives, containers, enums, modules/classes,
functions (incl. wrapped/partial/builtin), dataclasses, and objects
implementing ``__quack_semantic_key__(self) -> object`` are supported;
anything else raises at decoration time — a capture we cannot fingerprint
must never reach the compile cache, because a too-coarse key silently reuses
the wrong kernel. EpiOps implement the protocol as their ``cache_key()``.
Kernel classes are minted per (semantic digest, operand kinds, SM, modes)
but never cross the jit-cache boundary directly: compiles carry a picklable
:class:`~quack.gemm_host.GemmClassRef` recipe that re-mints the class at the
point of use — by importing the module-global EpiMod, or, for EpiMods with
no importable anchor (``__main__``, notebooks), via a digest-validated
cloudpickle payload installed into async workers as a side channel that
never touches the cache key. Same digest -> same disk ``.o``, across
processes and workers.

Why this design (and not an epilogue IR)
----------------------------------------
The goals are speed of light AND low marginal cost per new epilogue, and the
two pressures meet at the op boundary:

* The fn is the COMPOSITION site. Ordering (``rope(acc) * alpha`` vs
  ``rope(acc * alpha)``) is explicit user code, reviewable in place — not
  graph topology (EVT trees) or sequencing lists. CuTe-DSL's tracing already
  inlines the fn; an epilogue-level IR would only re-derive what MLIR below
  us optimizes anyway (shared subexpressions are shared SSA values for
  free), while hiding the packed-intrinsic and register-layout control the
  hand-written mixins prove is worth having.
* EpiOps are the EXTENSION site. Whoever adds an op — a new reduction, a
  quantized store, a table load with its own prefetch pipeline — writes the
  resource lifecycle once, and ONE port method (value / apply / sink) makes
  it usable from every fn, composed with every other op, with host plumbing,
  caching, and launch inherited from the schema. The proof cases:
  RotaryCosSinLoad ran verbatim with a 15-line adapter; OnlineLSEReduce
  (a coupled accumulator no combine= flag could express) is one class that
  every mod can name in ``outs=``. Ops written before this frontend existed
  keep working in hand-written mixins unchanged — the fn form is a shortcut
  onto the same machinery, never a second framework.
* The escape hatches are graded, not cliffs: pin one operand (``ops=``),
  add one port method, or drop to a full mixin — each step keeps everything
  else composing.

Everything here is pinned by tests/test_gemm_epilogue.py: bitwise-or-1-ulp
and <=1% perf vs the hand-written mixins for every expressible epilogue.

    instances when shape inference is ambiguous. ``reduces`` declares reduce
    outputs ({name: ColVecReduce(name) or RowVecReduce(name)}): the fn returns
    the per-element value to accumulate under that name, the buffer arrives in
    ``epi_args`` shaped (l, m, n_tiles) for col / (l, m_tiles, n) for row.

    ``mode='acc_pair'`` is expressed in the fn body with ``unpack``/``pack``
    (see :class:`Pair`): gated is ``gate, up = unpack(acc)`` with a
    half-of-GEMM-N aux buffer
    (per-pair aux is 16-bit n-major; interleave gate/up along N in B exactly
    as with the hand-written kernels; row/tile/c operands arrive paired, col
    operands as one scalar since they broadcast along N). Use
    ``mode='packed_cd_b16x2'`` for dgated:
    ``x, y = unpack(c)`` + ``"D": pack(dx, dy)`` with C/D passed as their
    natural 16-bit n-major tensors at twice GEMM-N.

    ``vectorize=False`` keeps the SM100 fn-loop vectorizer off for this
    epilogue (no effect on other archs — only SM100 vectorizes this loop).
    Escape hatch for the upstream DSL vectorizer's crash bugs (fused
    two-result ``cute.math.sincos``; an arith-computed value reused in both
    ``pack()`` lanes — nondeterministic segfault/double-free/compile hang).
    It disables f32x2 packing of the fn math: free while the epilogue hides
    under the mainloop (rope_posfreq B300 K=4096: novec +0.01% vs vectorized
    +0.46% over bias-only), expensive once exposed (K=512: +72% vs +51% — the
    unpacked stream goes issue-bound). Escape hatch, not a tuning knob.
