# Block-scaled tensor API

Design for the blockscaled GEMM operand and output API: a typed operand container
is the ONLY operand form for blockscaled (MXFP8 / MXFP4 / NVFP4 / MXFP6) GEMMs
(it replaced the removed `(data, scale_factor)` tuple convention), and blockscaled
*output* dtypes complete the (a, b, d) format triple.

## 1. Motivation

The removed tuple API (`gemm((A, SFA), (B, SFB))`) had three problems:

1. **Ambiguous detection.** Future compressed operand types (2:4 structured-sparse
   with metadata, LUT-indexed) will also be `(data, aux)` pairs; `isinstance(X, tuple)`
   cannot distinguish them.
2. **No MXFP6.** PyTorch has no fp6 dtype, so a bare tensor cannot express e2m3/e3m2
   elements; a "scale dtype implies vec size" convention (e8m0->32, e4m3->16) cannot
   express new (scale dtype, vec size) combinations either.
3. **The tuple API loses NVFP4's per-tensor scale** - `blockscaled_quantize`
   requires the caller to fold `pts_A * pts_B` into GEMM `alpha` manually; forgetting
   it degrades accuracy silently.

## 2. Design decisions (with rationale)

Each decision is stated with the failure mode it prevents. Cross-checks against
torchao (`MXTensor`/`NVFP4Tensor`), PyTorch subclass mechanics, and PTX/CUTLASS fp6
constraints anchor the rationale where noted.

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | **The container is a non-differentiable plain object** - a frozen dataclass, not a `torch.Tensor` subclass, so it structurally cannot enter autograd. Training on quantized operands is out of scope by design: a forward-quantized operand is scaled along the wrong axis for both backward GEMMs (dgrad contracts N, wgrad contracts M; scales block along K), and the square-weight case (K==N) fails *silently*. Any training story is hp master weights + per-GEMM requantization, layered above this container. |
| D2 | **`shape`/`dtype` report the logical hp view** (unpacked shape, `orig_dtype`, default bf16) as honest computed properties. Storage truth lives in `qdata`/`scale`. The container is unpacked at the top of each public entry point (where `_unpack_operand` sits); **nothing below that line ever sees it** - custom ops, autotuner, `jit_cache`, TVM-FFI all see flat plain tensors. |
| D3 | **Transpose = qdata stride-swap view; scale untouched.** The blocked `(rm, rk, 32, 4, 4)` scale atom is not view-transposable; scale is defined as "always blocked along K in either orientation". Preserves the load-bearing `weight.T` / `qw.mT` idiom. qdata<->scale shape coupling is validated at gemm dispatch time (`validate_blockscaled_sf`), NOT at construction - varlen padded scale buffers must stay constructible. |
| D4 | **Format = frozen dataclass descriptor** (`BlockScaledFormat`), not an enum: storage dtype, elem bits, packing, scale dtype, sf_vec_size, k-alignment are *data per format*. New formats are data, not code. Registry + singletons; legacy string names (`"mxfp8"`) coerce. The original positional `elems_per_container` field remains in place for source/pickle compatibility; `storage_layout` versions layouts that it cannot express (packed fp6). |
| D5 | **Format crosses the custom-op boundary explicitly** as a scalar `bs_format: str` op-schema arg. Formats are never derived from tensor dtypes (no `SF_DTYPE_TO_VEC_SIZE` table, no fp4 `A.dtype` logical-K special case, no `gemm_blockscaled_ref` sf-vec ternary); `_sf_decode` is format-driven - this kills the "uint8 scale view decoded as e8m0 => NVFP4 silently runs as vec-32 MXFP8" trap. There is NO dtype->format inference site anywhere (the tuple path's `_legacy_format_from_dtypes`, the last one, was deleted with tuple support - D10). |
| D6 | **MXFP6 storage names are unambiguous and backward compatible.** Origin/main names `mxfp6_e2m3` / `mxfp6_e3m2` remain one-code-per-`uint8` byte containers, including their quantizer behavior and serialized descriptors. Kernel-ready `mxfp6_e2m3_packed` / `mxfp6_e3m2_packed` use `storage_layout="packed_lsb_v1"`: a little-endian 6-bit stream with element i at bits [6i, 6i+6), the CUTLASS SubbyteReference layout (`pack_uint6`/`unpack_uint6`). Packed gmem is what TMA unpack consumes (section 6), crossing FFI as raw `torch.uint8` of shape `(..., 3K/4)`. `to_packed()` migrates byte operands bit-exactly and canonicalizes descriptors emitted under the short-lived packed/unversioned naming. |
| D7 | **Loud failure, explicit surface.** No aten interception: torch ops reject the non-tensor container with a plain `TypeError`; the supported surface is the explicit methods (`mT`/`T`/`transpose` restricted to last-two-dims, `to(device)` - dtype conversion raises pointing at `dequantize()`, `clone`, `dequantize`). **No dequantize fallback** in a kernels library. Targeted `TypeError` guards at non-blockscaled entry points (`gemm_dact`, `gemm_symmetric`, `gemm_rms`, `gemm_norm_act`) for message quality. |
| D8 | **`per_tensor_scale` is a field** (NVFP4 only). `gemm` folds `pts_A * pts_B` into alpha at the unwrap site via the existing *tensor-alpha* path (no `.item()` sync; nvfp4-with-pts compiles the tensor-alpha kernel variant). |
| D9 | **torch.compile support via pytree registration** plus a normal inlineable construction helper for in-graph quantize. Pytree context is a versioned, JSON-safe encoding of every descriptor field, `orig_dtype`, and `quant_dim`, so custom/legacy formats survive `treespec_dumps`/`treespec_loads`; origin/main's old `(format_name, dtype, quant_dim)` context remains readable. It must not use `allow_in_graph`: that makes Dynamo treat the helper as an opaque op, whose non-Tensor `BlockScaledOperand` return is illegal under `fullgraph=True`. `_sf_encode` (e8m0->uint8 view across the op boundary, an Inductor `decompose_auto_functionalized` workaround) sits at the unwrap site. |
| D10 | **Containers are the only blockscaled operand form**: `(data, scale_factor)` tuples/lists are rejected at the unwrap site with a `TypeError` pointing at `BlockScaledOperand.from_parts`. Every blockscaled operand is therefore construction-validated before it reaches a GEMM. `blockscaled_quantize` / `blockscaled_quantize_dim0` keep their raw `(q, sf)` returns - they are quantizers, not operand constructors (changing the return silently corrupts `qa, sfa = ...` call sites); wrap via `from_parts`, or use `BlockScaledOperand.quantize` directly. The TVM-FFI direct path (`compile_blockscaled_gemm_tvm_ffi`) is plain-tensors-only forever. |
| D11 | **A and B carry independent formats end-to-end** (`bs_format_a` / `bs_format_b` through every layer, including the op schemas). Pair *legality* is hardware fact, owned by `mma_kind_for_pair` in `operand.py`, which rejects byte-container compatibility formats and returns `"mxf8f6f4"` for every kernel-ready non-nvfp4, non-both-mxfp4 pair (PTX: `mxf4nvf4` and `mxf4` need matching element types; `mxf8f6f4` mixes fp8/fp6/fp4 freely, with sub-byte operands TMA-unpacked from packed gmem into 8-bit SMEM containers). Pair *implementation* is enforced **per-architecture**: each `gemm_smXXX` kernel class owns the asserts for the (A, B, SF, D) dtype combinations it supports (`GemmSm100.is_valid_dtypes_and_scale_factor_vec_size`, asserted in its blockscaled setup path; different SM versions support different mx dtypes). SM100's matrix admits **mixed fp8 pairs (e4m3 x e5m2, both orders)**: the DSL's `MmaMXF8F6F4Op` takes independent a/b dtypes, and instruction-K is kind-derived (mxf4/mxf4nvf4 => 64 elements, mxf8f6f4 => 32), not element-width-derived. **Mixed pairs involving fp4/fp6 run via the TMA-unpack path** (section 6): packed gmem + `internal_type=Uint8` + byte-domain SMEM; the `a/b_mma_dtype` split through both compile paths carries the packed-fp6 boundary dtype. `validate_blockscaled_sf` checks per-operand dtypes and cross-checks logical K via the formats' `logical_k` mapping - packings may differ. |
| D12 | **Blockscaled output D is a first-class API**: `out_dtype: torch.dtype \| BlockScaledFormat \| str` on `gemm`/`gemm_add`/`gemm_act(+postact_dtype)`; the op-schema plumbing is `SFD` (mutated) + `bs_format_d`, completing the (a, b, d) format triple. See section 7. |

### Rejected alternatives

- **Raw `(data, scale_factor)` tuple operands**: the original convention; kept
  briefly behind a `DeprecationWarning`, then removed (D10). Ambiguous detection,
  no fp6, silently dropped NVFP4 per-tensor scales, and required a dtype->format
  inference site (section 1).
- **torchao `MXTensor` dependency**: its 2-D lazily swizzled scales do not fit quack's
  permanently-blocked scale atom or varlen padded buffers.
- **Enum-based format**: recreates the switch-on-format duplication one level up; the
  descriptor dataclass makes new formats data, not code (D4).
- **`torch.Tensor` subclass container**: rejected because there is no
  `nn.Parameter`/`state_dict`/autograd requirement to serve, and without one,
  wrapper-subclass construction, a `__torch_dispatch__` table, the traceable-subclass
  protocol, and advertised-metadata "lies" buy nothing over explicit methods on a
  frozen dataclass. The container's field set and constructors are exactly what a
  tensor-subclass wrapper would hold, so module citizenship can layer on top later
  without breaking this API.
- **Byte-container gmem formats for new GEMMs** (one uint8 byte per fp4/fp6
  element): rejected because TMA unpack consumes packed gmem directly (section 6), so
  byte containers would only double (fp4) or inflate by 4/3 (fp6) the gmem traffic.
  The origin/main descriptors remain registered for checkpoint compatibility and host-side
  conversion, but GEMM rejects them and points callers to `to_packed()`.

### Out of scope

- **`nn.Module` / `quack/linear.py` integration and autograd.** The container is
  non-differentiable by construction (D1). A kernel constraint shapes any future
  module layer: there is no mixed hp x quantized GEMM - both operands must carry
  scale factors.
- **Training.** A forward-quantized operand is scaled along the wrong axis for both
  backward GEMMs (D1); a training story would keep hp master weights and requantize
  per GEMM along each contraction axis. Relatedly for blockscaled outputs (section 7):
  a fused-quantize output is gemm + STE quantize, and saved quantized outputs are
  N-axis-blocked - the wrong axis for the consumer's wgrad - so training would save hp
  activations or accept dim1-requant error (the standard MX tradeoff).
- **NVFP4 outputs with a computed global amax** (needs a delayed or two-pass amax;
  section 7 requires an explicitly provided per-tensor scale instead).

## 3. `BlockScaledFormat` and `BlockScaledOperand` (`quack/blockscaled/operand.py`)

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BlockScaledFormat:
    name: str                    # includes unversioned byte and explicit *_packed fp6
    qdata_dtype: torch.dtype     # e4m3 | e5m2 | float4_e2m1fn_x2 | uint8
    cutlass_dtype_name: str      # CuTe-DSL MMA element type (may differ from storage: fp6)
    elem_bits: int               # 8 | 4 | 6
    elems_per_container: int     # legacy positional contract; 2 for fp4x2, else 1
    scale_dtype: torch.dtype     # float8_e8m0fnu | float8_e4m3fn
    sf_vec_size: int             # 32 | 16 (also the min logical-K divisibility)
    has_per_tensor_scale: bool   # nvfp4 only
    storage_layout: str | None   # "packed_lsb_v1" for *_packed fp6; None is legacy
```

- Hashable/picklable -> usable as dynamo guard ctx and kernel-cache key material; only
  `name` crosses the op schema.
- `logical_k(storage_k)` / `storage_k(logical_k)` map between the logical element
  extent and the storage extent. Container layouts use `elems_per_container`; the
  versioned packed-fp6 layout uses the 4-elements-per-3-bytes bit ratio that an integer
  field cannot express. `is_packed` and `is_byte_container` distinguish those paths.
  `to_cutlass_dtype()` (lazy
  cutlass import: `Float8E4M3FN`, `Float8E5M2`, `Float4E2M1FN`, `Float6E2M3FN`,
  `Float6E3M2FN`); `from_name`, `from_cutlass_dtypes`. Dtype-triple lookup filters
  byte containers and therefore resolves fp6 to the explicit packed descriptor.
- Kernel support is NOT a registry property: descriptors are registered and
  constructible (checkpoints, round-trips) independently of any kernel, and whether a
  GEMM can execute a given (A, B, D) dtype combination is asserted per-architecture
  inside the `gemm_smXXX` classes (SM100 accepts any fp8/fp6/fp4 mix under
  kind::mxf8f6f4 - see section 6).
- E5M2: `quantize` encodes via `to_mx(..., elem_dtype=torch.float8_e5m2)`
  (fp8_max 57344, max_pow2 15); `from_parts` also works for pre-quantized data.
- `mxfp4_byte` and unversioned byte-container MXFP6 checkpoints retain their logical
  shape and dequantization after load. They are host-side compatibility formats only;
  `BlockScaledOperand.to_packed()` preserves their codes/scales exactly for GEMM use.
- Pickle migration distinguishes schemas structurally: origin/main states contain
  `elems_per_container` and keep byte semantics, while the short-lived feature state
  omits both packing fields and migrates fractional FP6 to the explicit `*_packed` name.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, eq=False)        # plain container, not a Tensor
class BlockScaledOperand:
    qdata: Tensor                        # storage dtype, packed shape, K-/MN-contiguous
    scale: Tensor                        # (rm, rk, 32, 4, 4) or (L, ...), atom strides (16, 4, 1)
    format: BlockScaledFormat
    per_tensor_scale: Optional[Tensor]   # scalar fp32, NVFP4 only
    orig_dtype: torch.dtype              # hp provenance; reported by .dtype
    quant_dim: int                       # quantized-axis flag (see below)
```

- **Logical metadata as computed properties**: `shape` (unpacked; packed dim = the
  unit-stride dim of qdata - packed sub-byte formats are K-major by kernel
  requirement, so unit-stride == packed == K), `dtype = orig_dtype` (hp provenance;
  storage truth is `qdata.dtype`), `device`, `ndim`.
- **Quantized axis** `quant_dim in {-1, -2}`: which logical dim the scale vector runs
  along - the direct analogue of CUTLASS's `UMMA::Major` SF-atom parameter. Storage
  alone cannot express it - a square fp8 canonical operand and its `.mT` view are
  byte-identical. Sub-byte packing pins it to the packed dim (conflicting requests
  raise); byte formats default to -1 (quantize's convention); transpose views flip it;
  `quantize(dim=-2)` and `from_parts(quant_dim=-2)` build the other direction
  directly. Carried through pytree/pickle; used by `dequantize()`. **The interface
  enforces per operand slot that the quantized axis is the contraction axis** (A: -1,
  B: -2), which makes the square-shape wrong-axis case a loud error instead of silent
  garbage.
- **Cross-check vs CUTLASS (sm100_blockscaled_layout.hpp):** CUTLASS models the same
  two quantization directions as `SfKMajorAtom` / `SfMNMajorAtom` in
  `Sm1xxBlockScaledBasicChunk` - and the MN-major atom is literally the mode-swap
  (transpose) of the K-major one, same 512 B physical block. Our `quant_dim` flag +
  `.mT` views are isomorphic to that template parameter: an "MN-quantized (M, K)
  tensor" is byte-identical to a K-quantized (K, M) tensor viewed transposed. For MMA
  *operands* only the K direction is consumable (`Sm1xxBlockScaledConfig`, used by
  every SM100 blockscaled mainloop, pins the K-major chunk - tcgen05 applies SF along
  the reduction dim by instruction definition). The MN direction exists for the
  *output* side and non-GEMM consumers - see section 7.
- **Constructor validation (mode-independent only, D3, in `__post_init__`):** qdata
  dtype <-> format; qdata has a unit-stride dim; scale ndim in {5, 6}, inner atom
  `(32, 4, 4)` with strides `(16, 4, 1)`; scale dtype = `fmt.scale_dtype` or a uint8
  view (re-viewed to the format dtype - canonicalization); pts only when
  `fmt.has_per_tensor_scale`. **No qdata<->scale shape coupling** (varlen buffers).
- Constructors: `from_parts(qdata, scale, format, *, per_tensor_scale=None,
  orig_dtype=bf16, quant_dim=-1)` and `quantize(x_hp, format, *, dim=-1,
  per_tensor_scale=None)`, both via an ordinary helper that Dynamo inlines through
  under `torch.compile`.
  Explicit `dequantize()`; never implicit. It requires the canonical dense scale
  shape: padded varlen buffers need `cu_seqlens` offsets the container does not carry,
  so dequantization rejects them rather than silently applying padding as real scales.
- torch.compile / pytree: `register_pytree_node` with children `(qdata, scale, pts)`
  and ctx `(format.name, orig_dtype, quant_dim)` - same mechanics as the legacy tuple.
- Serialization: native dataclass pickling;
  `add_safe_globals([BlockScaledOperand, BlockScaledFormat])` at import for
  `weights_only=True` loading.
- `repr` is metadata-only (no storage access).


### Extension seams (forward pointers)

The descriptor bundles two orthogonal things: the *element encoding* (qdata
dtype, bits, packing, DSL type) and the *scale recipe* (scale dtype,
`sf_vec_size` = the K-extent of a `(1, sf_vec_size)` block grid). The other
axes — 2D scale grids, physical scale layouts, DSL-typeless formats, per-kind
sided-ness — are designed in section 9 and stress-tested in section 10; the
hardenings they justify in this PR (`cutlass_dtype_name` Optional; explicit
element-class + recipe gates in `mma_kind_for_pair`) are already in place.

## 4. GEMM interface integration (`quack/gemm_interface.py`)

- `_unpack_operand(X)` -> `_Operand(data, sf, fmt, pts, quant_dim)` NamedTuple; accepts
  `BlockScaledOperand | Tensor`. A tuple/list raises `TypeError` pointing at
  `BlockScaledOperand.from_parts` (tuple support and its
  `_legacy_format_from_dtypes` dtype-inference site are gone - D10).
- Blockscaled-capable entry points (`gemm`, `gemm_add`, `gemm_add_inplace`, `gemm_act`,
  `gemm_gated`): pair-legality check via `mma_kind_for_pair` (D11); scale atoms were
  already validated at construction (every blockscaled operand is a container), so the
  unwrap site only applies `_sf_encode`; pts folding into alpha (D8).
- Both operands must be blockscaled or neither: there is no mixed hp x quantized GEMM
  kernel, so one-sided scale factors are rejected.
- Custom ops `quack::gemm_out`, `gemm_add_out`, `gemm_add_inplace`, `gemm_act_out`,
  `gemm_gated_out` carry `bs_format_a` / `bs_format_b` (`Optional[str]`; string args
  need no fake-side changes; fakes stay no-ops - D11: A and B formats are
  independent). Op bodies resolve both descriptors; `_sf_decode(SF, fmt)` is
  format-driven per operand.
- The `gemm_add` add-to-output path passes flat, already-unpacked parts instead of
  rebuilding operand containers.
- `gemm_blockscaled_ref`: accepts containers; `sf_vec = fmt.sf_vec_size`; applies
  `pts_A * pts_B`.
- Rejection guards (`TypeError`) at `gemm_dact`, `gemm_symmetric`, `gemm_rms`,
  `gemm_norm_act`.

## 5. Kernel-path plumbing (`gemm.py`, `gemm_epilogue.py`, `gemm_tvm_ffi_utils.py`)

- `quack.gemm.gemm` and `quack.gemm_act.gemm_act` take `bs_format_a`/`bs_format_b`,
  **both required** when SFA is passed - the kernel-level API carries formats
  explicitly, same as the custom ops.
- `validate_blockscaled_sf(A, B, SFA, SFB, ..., fmt_a=, fmt_b=)`: per-operand vec
  size / scale dtype / qdata dtype from the descriptors; logical K via each format's
  `logical_k(storage_k)` mapping with an A<->B cross-check (no fp4 dtype special
  case; fp6-correct by construction); validates layout and consistency ONLY -
  dtype-combination support is enforced per-architecture by the kernel classes.
  Activation and gated GEMMs use the shared `EpiMod` path in `gemm_epilogue.py`,
  which performs the same validation before building a plan through `gemm_host.py`.
- `_compile_gemm` / `_compile_gemm_epi` cache keys: `(sf_dtype, sf_vec_size,
  a_mma_dtype, b_mma_dtype)`, all derived from `fmt` at the caller. Both compile
  paths are `@jit_cache`-keyed on their full argument tuples INCLUDING the MMA
  dtypes, so the two packed-fp6 encodings key distinctly despite sharing uint8
  storage. The AB cute boundary dtype comes from
  `torch2cute_dtype_map[A.dtype]`; for packed fp6 that is `Uint8`, while
  `a/b_mma_dtype` drives the MMA builder and dtype-validity checks. The fake-tensor
  spec uses a byte-extent K symbol for fp6 because `div_for_dtype` with width 6 is
  non-integral (96 bytes = 128 logical elements).
- `_blockscaled_format_of` is a shim over `BlockScaledFormat.from_cutlass_dtypes`.
  Its legacy direct-compiler generator still rejects packed FP6 because that path
  has no separate uint8 storage dtype / FP6 MMA dtype; unified and varlen APIs do.
- `compile_blockscaled_gemm_tvm_ffi`: asserts plain tensors; docstring states the policy.

## 6. Sub-byte operands: mixed fp4/fp6/fp8

Any A/B pair of {mxfp8_e4m3, mxfp8_e5m2, mxfp4, mxfp6_e2m3_packed,
mxfp6_e3m2_packed} runs on
SM100 under tcgen05 `kind::mxf8f6f4` - including fp6 x fp4, where both operands
unpack. Both-fp4 runs the single denser `kind::mxf4nvf4` atom, parameterized by the
format's scale config (vec 32 e8m0 = mxfp4 - PTX spells that instantiation
`kind::mxf4` - vec 16 = nvfp4, mirroring CUTLASS C++'s `SM100_MMA_MXF4_SS<..., VS>`);
nvfp4 pairs only with itself (the scale config is instruction-wide). Concretely,
quack subclasses the DSL's `MmaMXF4NVF4Op` to un-pin its hardcoded vec 16 and
always constructs it for both-fp4 (`quack/sm100_utils.py:
make_blockscaled_trivial_tiled_mma`) - safe because both DSL fp4 op classes build
the identical MLIR atom type (no kind attribute; the backend derives the PTX
spelling from the vec size).

**The TMA-unpack recipe (mirrors CUTLASS C++ `SmemAllocType=uint8_t`):** per unpack
operand - a packed sub-byte gmem operand in any pair other than both-packed-fp4:

- **gmem keeps the true sub-byte element type** (`Float4E2M1FN` / `Float6E*FN`,
  packed). Passing `internal_type=cutlass.Uint8` to `make_tiled_tma_atom_A/B`
  sets `use_unpack` (`cute/nvgpu/helpers.py:153-175`) and selects the
  `TmaDataFormat.U4_UNPACK_U8` / `U6_UNPACK_U8` tensormap
  (= `CU_TENSOR_MAP_DATA_TYPE_16U4/16U6_ALIGN16B`). Recasting gmem to Uint8
  kills `use_unpack` (that is the sm103 example's *packed*-smem mxf4 path, a
  different convention).
- **Everything SMEM-side is byte-domain (Uint8)**: `make_smem_layout_a/b`
  dtype, `MemRange` storage, stage budgeting. TMA expands each 16 packed
  elements into a 16-byte smem footprint (8B fp4 / 12B fp6 packed chunk + gap),
  i.e. one byte of footprint per element; no software indexes below 16B.
- **The Uint8-typed smem tensor feeds `make_fragment_A/B` directly.** The DSL
  never checks the fragment dtype against the MMA dtype and builds the smem
  descriptor from width x stride products, so the byte layout yields the correct
  LBO/SBO (16-byte units). An f4-typed `make_smem_layout_a(..., Float4E2M1FN)`
  layout is WRONG here - that is the SW64 packed-mxf4 convention with a halved K
  stride. The sub-byte identity reaches the instruction only via the tiled_mma's
  `a/b_mma_dtype` (instruction-descriptor format bits).
- **mbarrier tx counts packed bytes** (elements x 4 or 6 bits - the gaps are
  not written), matching CUTLASS `sizeof_bits<ElementA> x cosize(SmemLayoutA)`.
  quack's existing `size_in_bytes(a_dtype, a_smem_layout)` line does this
  automatically once the layout is byte-domain and `a_dtype` stays sub-byte.
- **Constraints** (CUDA driver, cuTensorMapEncodeTiled): unpack operands are
  K-major with logical K % 128 (globalDim[0] rule; also = the 96B fp6 / 64B fp4
  inner-extent rules), base address 32B-aligned, byte strides % 32, boxDim[0]
  exactly 128 elements (satisfied by the SW128 byte-domain atom). Enforced:
  arg-spec k divisibility 128 (fp4-mixed), fp6 K%128 assert in
  `validate_blockscaled_sf`, `GemmSm100.can_implement` K%128 + per-operand
  K-major, and 32B fake-argument/per-launch alignment checks (the latter also
  protects cached plans whose keys do not include data pointers).

**Kernel structure (`gemm_sm100.py`):** per-operand `a/b_unpack` flags +
`a/b_smem_dtype` (Uint8 when unpack) derived next to the dtype resolution;
byte-domain smem layouts/storage/stage-budget; `internal_type=Uint8` on the A/B
TMA atoms; the dtype gate accepts fp8/fp4/fp6 MMA dtypes in any mix (fp6 copy dtype
may be Uint8 - see the FFI boundary below); the 16B-alignment helper uses a
128-element granule for width 6 (16*8//6 is fractional).

**fp6 FFI boundary:** torch has no fp6 dtype (and no `float6_x4`-style packed
dtype to ride the way fp4 rides `float4_e2m1fn_x2`), so packed-fp6 qdata crosses
tvm-ffi as raw `torch.uint8` of shape `(..., 3K/4)` - a little-endian 6-bit
stream, element i at bits [6i, 6i+6), the CUTLASS SubbyteReference layout
(bit-identical to the DSL's own fp6 fill kernel). The arg spec gives the byte
extent an independent sym (divisibility 96 = 128 elements; the 4/3 relation
between shared syms is not expressible - logical-K consistency is checked
host-side), and `GemmSm100.__call__` reinterprets it via `_reinterpret_packed_fp6`
(recast_ptr to `Float6E*FN` + logical layout: K extent x4/3, K stride stays 1,
outer byte strides x4/3 - exact since rows are whole 96-byte groups).
`a/b_mma_dtype` (threaded through both compile paths) is what marks the operand as
packed fp6 at the boundary.

## 7. Blockscaled outputs: SF-generation epilogue

All other kernel `sf_*` plumbing is input-side; blockscaled D adds the output side.

- API (D12): `out_dtype` accepts a `BlockScaledFormat` (or name) on
  `gemm`/`gemm_add`/`gemm_act`; the plain blockscaled output default stays bf16. A
  format request makes `gemm` allocate qdata + an SFD buffer in the blocked layout
  and return a `BlockScaledOperand`; `out=` accepts a container (unwrapped at the
  operand seam); the ops carry `SFD: Optional[Tensor]` (in `mutates_args`) +
  `bs_format_d` - completing the (a, b, d) format triple; `_sf_encode` applies to
  SFD.
- Semantics: quantize along the **last dim (N)** - the next GEMM's contraction dim; the
  N-contiguous output is automatically a K-major operand for the consumer (what fp4
  requires). MX formats only (single-pass per-tile amax); NVFP4 output requires an
  explicitly provided per-tensor scale (a global amax is not computable in one pass).
- **SFD direction is a parameter, not a constant** (cross-checked vs CUTLASS):
  `Sm1xxBlockScaledOutputConfig<SFVecSize, major>` supports vec-along-N (Major::K,
  for D consumed as the next GEMM's A) AND vec-along-M (Major::MN, for D consumed as
  the next B / dgrad-style consumers); the SM100 epilogue SFD store instantiates both,
  selected by the requested SFD layout tag (see also examples/91_fp4_gemv's
  `kIsKMajorSFD`). The API therefore carries a direction knob alongside
  `bs_format_d` (default: vec along N), producing a `BlockScaledOperand` with the
  corresponding `quant_dim`.
- Kernel: CUTLASS `LinCombBlockScaleFactor` precedent - per-32-block amax over the
  accumulator subtile, e8m0 scale with the same floor rule as `to_mx` (bit-exact
  testability against `to_mx(gemm_ref(...))`), divide+convert, write qdata + 512 B SF
  atoms. `tile_n % 64` already enforced. Requires `split_k == 1` (quantization is
  only valid after the full K reduction). Works on hp-input GEMMs too (bf16 x bf16 ->
  mxfp8 is the network's first quantization); `gemm_act`/`gemm_gated` composition
  (quantized postact) is the MLP forward fusion payoff.

## 8. Testing

Everything is validated numerically against dequantization references, never by
shape or smoke checks alone.

- Container (`tests/test_blockscaled_operand.py`): construction rejects (dtype/format
  mismatch, bad atom strides, pts on non-nvfp4), uint8-scale canonicalization,
  varlen-padded scale construction; `clone`/`.to(device)` (dtype-`to` raises pointing
  at dequantize); `.mT`/`.T`/`transpose` round-trips with the SAME scale object; loud
  TypeError from torch ops; repr; deepcopy; save/`load(weights_only=True)`; pytree
  round-trip (orientation flag included), including JSON TreeSpec serialization for
  custom and legacy formats; rejection guards at the non-blockscaled entry points.
- Interface (`tests/test_gemm_blockscaled_interface.py`): the dtype matrix runs on
  containers (the only operand form); a negative test pins the tuple/list
  `TypeError` (removal regression); regression tests encoding the failure modes the
  design exists to prevent: **pts-folding** (non-unit pts, default alpha => matches
  the dequant ref), **square-weight orientation** (K==N `.mT`), **uint8-scale-view
  decode** (nvfp4 stays vec-16), **mixed-format rejection**; one **e5m2 from_parts**
  run.
- Compile: container as fullgraph input (attribute reads + the e8m0/Inductor
  regression); in-graph `quantize` + gemm fullgraph; an in-graph `from_parts`
  compile test with raw (q, sf) graph inputs.
- Mixed pairs: representative fp8/fp6/fp4 A/B combinations are validated against
  the dequantized-operand reference at the same tolerance as the fp8-pair baseline,
  including fp6 x fp4 where both operands unpack; the packed 6-bit stream is checked
  bit-exact against the DSL's fp6 fill kernel.
- Numerics references: `gemm_blockscaled_ref` dequant-matmul, plus bit-exact
  `torch._scaled_mm` comparison via `scale_blocked_for_cublas`.

## 9. Generalization: scale recipes, layouts, and software kinds

Design for extending the operand API beyond MX/NVFP4 microscaling. Consumers
in flight: the SM90 blockwise-promotion GEMM (sm90kscale: fp32 scales,
`kscale_block in {128, 256}`, one-sided bf16), the SM100 linear-SF cp.async
loader (sfcpasync: per-operand `sfa_linear`/`sfb_linear`), the SM90
weight-only family (sm90w4: W4A8 / W4A16 / W8A16), and DeepSeek-style fp8
recipes (acts 1x128, weights 128x128). The generalization lands WITH its
first consumer kernel; only the seams live in this PR.

### 9.1 Model

A block-scaled operand represents

```
X[i, j] ~= decode(qdata)[i, j] * S[i // bm, j // bk] * (pts if present)
```

- **Level-0 scale grid**: block shape `(bm, bk)` over the logical `(MN, K)`
  index space -> grid `(ceil(MN/bm), ceil(K/bk))`, any scale dtype.
- **Level-1**: the optional per-tensor scalar. Scaling is a hierarchy of
  levels; we support exactly two, level 1 fixed at per-tensor fp32 (a
  deliberate cap, stated like D1).
- **Element encoding is orthogonal** and includes full-precision types: bf16
  elements with per-K-block fp32 scales (kscale) are a valid operand. The
  container is about *block scaling*; quantization is the special case of a
  narrow element type.

The recipe axis is the ecosystem's own taxonomy, factored into fields instead
of an enum: cuBLASLt's `cublasLtMatmulMatrixScale_t` (`SCALAR_32F`,
`VEC16_UE4M3`, `VEC32_UE8M0`, `OUTER_VEC_32F`, `VEC128_32F`,
`BLK128x128_32F`, `PER_BATCH_SCALAR_32F` - set independently per operand via
`A_SCALE_MODE`/`B_SCALE_MODE`, i.e. D11 is their design too) and torch's
`_ScalingType` (`TensorWise, RowWise, BlockWise1x16/1x32/1x128/128x128`) are
flat enumerations of the same `(bm, bk, scale dtype)` points.

| recipe | bm | bk | scale dtype | elements |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mxfp8 / mxfp4 / mxfp6_*_packed | 1 | 32 | e8m0 | fp8/4/6 |
| nvfp4 | 1 | 16 | e4m3 (+pts) | fp4 |
| DeepSeek 1D (acts) | 1 | 128 | fp32 | e4m3 |
| DeepSeek 2D (weights) | 128 | 128 | fp32 | e4m3 |
| kscale bf16 | 1 | 128/256 | fp32 | bf16 |
| int4-g128 (AWQ/GPTQ, W4A16) | 1 | 128 | bf16 | uint4b8 |
| rowwise (per-token / per-channel) | 1 | K (full) | fp32 | fp8/int8 |

### 9.2 Three axes, three homes

| concern | lives on | crosses op boundary as |
|---|---|---|
| element encoding + scale recipe | `BlockScaledFormat` | `bs_format_{a,b}` name |
| physical scale layout | `BlockScaledOperand` | `bs_layout_{a,b}` name |
| orientation | `BlockScaledOperand.quant_dim` | (existing) |

The format is the **interchange contract** (numerics); the layout is a
**storage detail** (like strides) - the same format legitimately exists in
multiple layouts (mxfp8 blocked for tcgen05, mxfp8 linear from a fused quant
producer), so layout is per-OPERAND (the kernels take `sfa_linear` /
`sfb_linear` independently) and never part of the format identity. Layout is
never inferred: blocked (5/6-D) vs linear (2/3-D) is rank-sniffable today,
but that is the D5 trap again and breaks on the first same-rank layout.

### 9.3 Descriptor changes (all defaulted - zero churn for existing formats)

- `sf_block_mn: int = 1` - the MN-extent of the block grid (128 for 2D).
- `sf_vec_size: Optional[int]` - `None` = the full contraction extent
  (rowwise; cuBLASLt `OUTER_VEC`). AMENDED from the first draft: forced by
  w4a8 per-token activation scales and w8a16 per-channel weight scales - a
  format descriptor is shape-independent and cannot spell a literal K.
- `canonical_scale_layout: str = "mx_blocked"` - what `quantize()` emits and
  what an unspecified operand layout means. DECIDED: MX formats stay blocked;
  "linear" is an accepted per-operand option; fp32-scale recipes are
  canonically linear (no blocked form exists for them).
- New registry rows land with their consumer kernels (never speculatively);
  see the commented examples next to `BLOCKSCALED_FORMAT_REGISTRY` and
  `test_future_recipe_examples`.
- `quantize()` policy: fp8 recipes get a generic `(bm, bk)` amax quantizer
  (e8m0 keeps the floor rule). bf16 and int-group formats RAISE - floating-
  point relative precision is scale-invariant and group scales are upstream-
  structural (GPTQ/AWQ groups, folded norms), so `from_parts` is the
  construction path.

### 9.4 Scale layouts (per-operand)

`BlockScaledOperand.scale_layout: Optional[str]` (`None` -> the format's
canonical layout; carried by `_view`, pytree ctx, pickle).

| tag | shape | constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `"mx_blocked"` | `(L?, rm, rk, 32, 4, 4)`, atom strides `(16,4,1)` | requires `bm == 1` and e8m0/e4m3 scales (it IS the tcgen05 atom) |
| `"linear"` | `(L?, ceil(MN/bm), ceil(K/bk))`, K-block dim contiguous | ecosystem name (FlashInfer/TRT-LLM `layout_linear`; torchao "plain"; scaled_mm NO_SWIZZLE) |

Construction validation becomes a dispatch keyed on the tag; future tags are
additive. `repack_scales(layout)` converts (linear->blocked is the existing
`pack_scale_2d_to_blocked_contig`; the quantizers already produce the linear
grid internally, so a linear-canonical `quantize` is cheaper, not costlier).
`quant_dim` and the `.mT` scale-carry trick are untouched - the grid axes are
interpreted through `quant_dim`, so D3 generalizes to 2D grids for free.

### 9.5 Kinds and sided-ness: `gemm_kind_for_pair`

Supersedes `mma_kind_for_pair` (which remains, delegated to, for the hardware
subset - it already gates element class AND recipe so software recipes fail
at kind selection with the reason). Takes `Optional` formats on both sides:
**sided-ness is per-kind, not an interface invariant**.

```
(bs, bs)  hw recipe on both (bm==1, bk in {16,32}, e8m0/e4m3, DSL elem)
    -> mxf4nvf4 | mxf4 | mxf8f6f4          # existing rules, unchanged
(bs, bs)  fp8 elements, fp32 scales         -> blockwise_promote  # 1d1d / 1d2d
(bs, None) bf16 elements, fp32 K-block scales -> blockwise_promote  # kscale
(None, bs) plain acts x group-scaled weights -> upconvert (W4A16/W8A16 family)
(None, None)                                 -> the ordinary GEMM path
```

Pairing rule (AMENDED): sides that block K must agree on `bk` (the promotion
interval must align); **k-invariant scales compose freely** - rowwise and
per-tensor scales factor out of the K loop entirely
(`out[m,n] = sfa[m]*sfb[n]*sum_k ...`) and apply at epilogue or
promotion-end, so w4a8 legally pairs rowwise fp8 acts with group-128 int4
weights. One-sided pairs use a **plain Tensor** for the unscaled side
(DECIDED - no identity-scale wrapper: the container's contract is "carries
block scales"). Whether scales apply in the register decode (W4A16 nvfp4:
2 significand bits x e4m3's 4 fit bf16 exactly), at k-tile promotion (w4a8,
DeepGEMM), or in the epilogue (rowwise) is per-arch implementation, invisible
to the API. Integer elements (e0m3/nvint4 = int4 + a recipe) get an
int-accumulate promote variant via tcgen05 `kind::i8` - exact int32 inner
products, scales at promotion.

Per-arch gates own the support matrices, as in D11: SM100 tcgen05 kinds +
linear-loader constraints (`K/vec % 4 == 0`; `sfa_linear` needs cluster
N == 1); SM90 promote/upconvert matrices (`bk in {128, 256}`, `split_k == 1`,
no `gather_A` - the kernels' existing asserts, fronted by descriptors).

### 9.6 Host plumbing

`gemm()` signature unchanged - everything rides on the operands. Op schemas
gain `bs_layout_{a,b}` strings (same pattern as `bs_format_{a,b}`); autotune
and compile keys gain the layout tags; kernel flags are derived from operands
(`sfa_linear = (opA.scale_layout == "linear")`, `kscale_sfb_1d =
(fmt_b.sf_block_mn == 1)`, ...). The D8 precedent extends: scales needed to
*interpret an operand's bytes* travel WITH the operand - a forgotten `(N,)`
per-channel multiply after a W8A16 GEMM is the pts-folding silent-accuracy
trap again, and the container is what killed that class of bug.

### 9.7 Prepared operands are NOT formats (a fence)

The weight-only kernels repack weights offline into kernel-private blobs
(WGMMA-fragment nibble shuffles, SF strips like `(N/64, K/64, 32, 4, 2)`).
These must never enter the format/layout vocabulary: they are not interchange
forms (no second consumer can read them) and they version with the kernel.
They are a third tier - **prepare-and-cache above the container**, keyed on
`(qdata storage identity, kernel key)`; weights are static so the one-time
cost amortizes. The canonical container is what serializes; prepared blobs
are rebuilt on load, which is what makes kernel-layout changes non-breaking.
Precedent: torch.ao prepacked params, TRT-LLM
`preprocess_weights_for_mixed_gemm`.

### 9.8 Decisions and sequencing

`sf_vec_size` keeps its name (`sf_block_mn` is the only new recipe field
besides the full-extent sentinel). MX canonical layout stays blocked.
One-sided = plain Tensor. bk=256 rows, ue8m0-scale DeepSeek variants, and all
registry rows land on first demand, with their consumer kernels
(sm90kscale / sfcpasync / sm90w4 integration - whichever merges first
carries the descriptor generalization).

## 10. Stress tests (worked examples)

This table is the abstraction's regression suite: every new format proposal
gets checked against it and either lands as a data row (good) or forces a
minimal, named amendment (recorded). Seven adversarial cases produced two
one-line amendments. Executable versions:
`test_future_recipe_examples` / `test_format_without_dsl_element_type`.

| case | axis exercised | change forced |
|---|---|---|
| e3m4 (no DSL type; bundled MLIR has `f8E3M4` but the DSL's reverse dispatch and dtype tables do not) | DSL-typeless elements | `cutlass_dtype_name` Optional + element-class gate (LANDED in this PR) |
| e0m3 / nvint4 (= int4 element + nvfp4's recipe; MLIR `i4`, DSL `Int4`, torch.int4 all exist) | integer elements | none - int promote via `kind::i8` is a kind, not a descriptor change |
| DeepSeek 1x128 / 128x128 fp32 scales | recipe: scale dtype + 2D grid | `sf_block_mn` (follow-up field) |
| kscale bf16 + per-row fp32 K-block scales | full-precision elements; one-sided | vocabulary ("quantized" -> "block-scaled"); sided-ness moved into kind rules |
| sfcpasync linear SF `(MN, K/vec)` | physical layout | `scale_layout` per-operand tag (follow-up field) |
| W4A16 nvfp4 weights x bf16 acts | same format, new pairing | none - the SM100 tcgen05 operand and the SM90 upconvert weight are ONE format |
| W4A8 / W8A16 (rowwise acts / per-channel weights) | full-extent bk; mixed-recipe pairs | `sf_vec_size` sentinel; pairing rule relaxed to "k-invariant composes freely" |

Known unmodeled, deliberately (add only with a customer): per-group zero
points (a third block-grid tensor; uint4b8's FIXED offset is element decode
and costs nothing) and per-L batch scales (cuBLASLt `PER_BATCH_SCALAR_32F` -
a third grid extent).
